         For all of my life, I have loved the outdoors. I grew up more or less in the country, running down gravel
         roads barefoot or exploring the woods behind our house. Somewhere along the line, I found a love for birds
         that has only grown through the years. Being a military spouse for 13 years gave me the opportunity to live
         in 3 different states, not including Missouri, and that allowed me to see unique birds in each state.
         The following is a list of my top 10 favorite birds I've seen in person in the wild, along with random
         stories and facts. It's probably worth noting that none of these pictures are ones I took (except for the
         ones that appear with the bold text), but they do a wonderful job of showing the beauty of each bird.

               <h2 class="leftPictureH2">1. Red-cockaded Woodpecker</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">The Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) isn't the most spectacular-looking bird,
                  but it made #1 on my list because this species of woodpecker is endangered and some small,
                  isolated groups are near extinction, so it's rare to see them. While living in Georgia, I went
                  with two friends to a gopher tortoise preserve where they are also trying to help the RWC
                  population. RCWs are the only woodpeckers to build their homes in live trees. Once they find
                  their preferred tree, they begin making their home, which they return to every year, fully
                  finishing their home after 7 years. RCWs prefer live trees to use for protection; they peck
                  holes in the bark around the tree to cause sap to run out, which deters predators like snakes
                  from climbing into their cavities and eating their eggs or fledglings. Older "siblings" will
                  also return to help raise the next brood of their parents, which I think is pretty cool. For me,
                  getting to see RCWs in the wild was a very rare and special event.

               <h2 class="rightPictureH2">2. Roseate Spoonbill</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">The Roseate Spoonbill made #2 on my list because.... well, just look at
                  it! This bird is so unique to me. They mostly live along the southern coasts of Florida, Texas,
                  and Central and South America. I was pretty excited when I learned that a few decided to visit a
                  wild bird sanctuary in South Carolina, not far from where I lived at the time in Georgia. I went
                  there with my friend and her husband, who are both wildlife biologists, and we managed to find
                  three juvenile male roaseate spoonbills. They were hanging out with hundreds of
                  <span><strong>wood storks</strong></span> eating fish in the lowered ponds at the sanctuary.
                  Since they weren't full-grown adults, their feathers weren't as bright pink as the one in the
                  image, but their feathers were a soft, rosy shade of pink. I will never forget seeing these
                  fun-looking birds and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to see them in real life; otherwise,
                  I'm not sure I would've ever known of their existence!

               <h2 class="leftPictureH2">3. Western Tanager</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">For my third favorite bird, I chose the Western Tanager. I've only seen
                  one in person once, and it was pretty magical. From the end of 2017 to early 2021, we lived in
                  Fort Carson, CO, in the shadow of Cheyenne Mountain. (Ever heard of NORAD? I could see the
                  entrance from my backyard!) While living there, Cheyenne Mountain State Park completed a trail
                  that went to the top of Cheyenne Mountain, so in July of 2020 I hiked it with a close friend. It
                  was one of the hardest hikes I've ever done (mostly because we did an extra loop to see an
                  <span><strong>old homestead</strong></span> that wasn't worth it, which made our hike about 18
                  miles total, and I ran out of water by roughly mile 8). However, about 3-4 miles into our hike,
                  in the early morning hours, a little yellow, red, and black bird flew right up to me and landed
                  on a branch nearby. I, of course, gasped and froze in my tracks as I watched a handsome western
                  tanager hop around looking for his breakfast while keeping an eye on me. It was definitely one
                  of my favorite birding moments.

               <h2 class="rightPictureH2">4. Painted Bunting</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">My fourth favorite bird I've seen is the Painted Bunting. Usually, when I
                  show people a picture of a painted bunting, they think it's either not real or that the picture
                  has been way overphotoshopped and the colors aren't possibly that bright. While photos of
                  painted buntings are usually touched up so their colors stand out more, I can say that they
                  really do look that bright and beautiful in person! I was lucky enough to see painted buntings
                  on a somewhat regular basis while living in Georgia. We would hike a lot at a nature reserve
                  called Phinizy Swamp, and my kids and I would go looking for
                  <span><strong>alligators</strong></span> (which we saw a lot of!)
                  and painted buntings. We knew where they usually had their nests, so sometimes we would try and
                  draw them out by playing a painted bunting call on my phone. However, some birders frown on this
                  because overuse can stress the birds, which is why we only did it occasionally. I didn't enjoy
                  living in Georgia very much, but I would love to go back if only to see the painted buntings
                  again!

               <h2 class="leftPictureH2">5. Steller's Jay</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">The Steller's Jay! This was easily one of my favorite birds while living
                  in Colorado! I only ever saw steller's jays when I was out hiking. My first moment being
                  somewhat near a steller's jay was while I was hiking up Pikes Peak. I had the crazy idea of
                  hiking to the top of the mountain (elevation 14,111 feet!) one year after having heart failure
                  when I had my fourth baby. It was definitely the hardest hike I've ever done, but I made it to
                  the top! Roughly 5 miles into the hike, a steller's jay flew along the trail with me for a
                  while. I like to think he was encouraging me along the way. Another favorite encounter with a
                  steller's jay was when I made it to the top of the Manitou Springs Incline (a 1-mile stairway up
                  the side of a mountain. A total of 2,768 steps and 2,000 feet of
                  elevation gain). Both times when I made it to the top, I sat down for a snack and to feed the
                  <span><strong>friendly chipmunks</strong></span> when a
                  steller's jay flew down by me and squawked till I tossed him half
                  a grape. I'm slowly getting closer to my goal of being Snow White, where all the little woodland
                  creatures greet me while I'm in the woods!

               <p class="birdParagraphs">For my sixth favorite bird I've seen, I picked the Loggerhead Shrike. I
                  didn't even know this bird existed until I looked out into my backyard in Georgia and saw one
                  sitting on my fence. After identifying it, I fell down the rabbit hole of information about
                  these birds. One really cool trait of shrikes is that they store their uneaten prey by impaling
                  it on a thorn or barbed wire so they can return and eat it later. They mostly eat larger
                  insects, rodents, and small birds. The first time I saw one of these guys, he was feasting on a
                  large grasshopper. I noticed him hanging around for a few days, and I spotted a couple places
                  where he impaled other grasshoppers along the barbed wire that ran around the retention pond
                  behind my yard. Loggerhead shrikes are fierce birds, and I loved having one visit my yard and
                  learning all about them, plus they look like little bandits!

               <h2 class="leftPictureH2">7. Scissor-tailed Flycatcher</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">I didn't realize that my #7 bird, the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, was so
                  special until I started thinking about it being my favorite bird to see while I lived in Fort
                  Hood, TX, for 7 long years. Scissor-tailed flycatchers have a pretty small range where they
                  breed and winter. Central Texas doesn't have many pretty birds, so these easily topped the list.
                  I always saw one near my home. I'd go on a run, and there was always one that flew along with me
                  and would land ahead of me on a fence till I caught up. I didn't think they were too special
                  besides their cool-looking tails until I lived in Georgia and other birders lost their minds
                  when a scissor-tailed flycatcher was spotted in nearby South Carolina. I feel very lucky that I
                  got to see them on an almost daily basis while I lived in Texas!

               <h2 class="rightPictureH2">8. Bald Eagle</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">I almost feel a little cliche putting a Bald Eagle on my top 10 list, but
                  there is something magical about watching one fly above you in the wild. After living in Georgia
                  for about a year, a mated pair of bald eagles made a home for themselves in our favorite hiking
                  spot, Phinizy Swamp. One time, my girlfriends and I saw one fly past us with a fish in its beak.
                  Another time, just a few months ago (in Missouri), I was driving when a bald eagle flew out of
                  the trees and flew just over and ahead of me before veering off and into more woods on the other
                  side of the highway. It was quite the experience, and I slowed way down just to have a couple
                  extra seconds watching this beautiful bird soar right ahead of me (and thankfully I didn't have
                  anyone behind me)! Since moving back to Missouri, we've been having more and more bald eagle
                  sightings in my area, which is very exciting to me!</p>

               <h2 class="leftPictureH2">9. Belted Kingfisher</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">The Belted Kingfisher is a bird I've known about for a while but hadn't
                  been able to find in the wild because they're shy and elusive. The first time I saw one was in
                  Georgia while I was kayaking with a friend, and a kingfisher flew in the trees along the river
                  we were on. Then, after moving to Missouri, we ended up having a belted kingfisher frequent the
                  pond by the house all winter! I haven't had the opportunity to watch one dive into the water to
                  catch a meal, but you can find really cool pictures of them catching a fish online. Even though
                  these birds are shy and fly away as soon as I see them, they're still one of my favorites to see
                  in the wild, plus check out those feathers on their heads! Talk about a cool hairstyle!

               <h2 class="rightPictureH2">10. Broad-tailed Hummingbird</h2>
               <p class="birdParagraphs">Last but definitely not least is the Broad-tailed Hummingbird. While
                  living in Colorado, I had regular visits to my feeders from four species of hummingbirds, but
                  the most common was the broad-tailed. Originally, I didn't think much of them because they look
                  similar to the ruby-throated hummingbirds that we get here in Missouri, until I noticed a unique
                  sound coming from them while I was hiking. The male broad-tailed hummingbirds make a loud,
                  metallic trill sound with their wingtips when they fly, which I find so interesting. The
                  visitors to my feeders started getting used to me and would come sit on my feeder while I held
                  it. Broad-tailed hummingbirds are also quite resilient, despite their size. They breed mostly in
                  the mountains, go up to 10,000 ft in elevation, and can survive the harsh, cold snow. On
                  September 9, 2020, we got 4-5 inches of snow, and when I looked out in the morning, I saw a
                  broad-tailed hummingbird <span><strong>eating at my feeder!</strong></span> Hummingbirds are
                  some of my favorite species of birds, but the broad-tailed is probably my favorite!
